# glox - A Go Lox Interpreter

This is an implementation of the lox language, developed by Robert Nystrom in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The purpose of this project is a learning project, both for how interpreters work and for Nick Savage to experiment with Go.

This has made a number of different design chocies, compared to the original interpreter. `glox` includes the following:
- Lambda Functions
- Go-style `for` loops, with `break` and `continue`
