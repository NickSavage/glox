# glox - A Go Lox Interpreter

This is an implementation of the lox language, developed by Robert Nystrom in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The purpose of this project is a learning project, both for how interpreters work and for Nick Savage to experiment with Go.
